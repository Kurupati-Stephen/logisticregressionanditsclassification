üîç Step-by-Step Summary:
Dataset Selection:

Chose a binary classification dataset (e.g., Titanic, Breast Cancer, or any CSV with binary labels).

Data Preprocessing:

Performed train-test split using train_test_split.

Standardized features using StandardScaler to improve model performance.

Model Training:

Used LogisticRegression() from sklearn.linear_model to train the classifier.

Model Evaluation:

Generated predictions and evaluated using:

‚úÖ Confusion Matrix

‚úÖ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

‚úÖ ROC Curve and AUC Score

Threshold Tuning:

Explained how sigmoid output represents the probability.

Demonstrated how adjusting the decision threshold (default 0.5) affects classification results.

Insights:

Showed practical usage of logistic regression for classification problems.

Discussed the trade-off between precision and recall using ROC curve.
